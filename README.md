# MMSpaceX

I tried to use MVVM as close as possible.  We at Wells Frago are just starting to look at MVVM-C, which I think is a very good architecture.  I did not add the "c" is small app.  

This app is fairly complete, however as all challenges go there never is enough time to do everything.

If this was a real app, I would have included more data about the launches, and imported information such as launch sites, rocket name, etc.

Second the date fields are simply text fields, I would have added in real date spinners and parsed out the dates.  There should be more error trapping for the date ranges.

Of course adding landscape mode would be good also.
